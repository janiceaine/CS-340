Final Project - Dashboard Code and CRUD Python Module

Overview

This repository contains the final dashboard code and the corresponding CRUD Python module from Project One and Project Two. The dashboard connects to a database using the CRUD module and displays interactive widgets to the user. The code and project files are designed for future adaptability and scalability.

How to Use

To run the dashboard and use the CRUD Python module, follow the setup instructions below:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone 

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repository

Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the dashboard:

bash
Copy code
python dashboard.py
Code Structure
crud_module.py: Contains functions for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations that interact with the database.
dashboard.py: Handles the creation and display of the dashboard widgets, integrating the CRUD module.
requirements.txt: A list of the necessary dependencies for the project.


1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   
To ensure my programs are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I prioritize the following principles:

Modularity: Code is divided into small, reusable functions. In Project One, the CRUD Python module handles individual database operations, which can be easily extended or modified without affecting the entire project.
Clear Naming Conventions: Variable, function, and class names are descriptive, making the code easier to understand at a glance.
Documentation: Every module and function is documented, providing an understanding of its purpose and usage.
By following these practices, the code is not only easy to maintain but also adaptable for future use cases. For example, the CRUD module can be reused in future projects by adjusting the database connection details or expanding the functionalities to meet new requirements.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
 
As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I started by understanding the data needs and the required dashboard functionality. I designed the database schema and then built the CRUD Python module to interact with the database. Unlike previous assignments, this project required integrating both the backend (database) and the frontend (dashboard), which involved ensuring that data was dynamically fetched and displayed. Going forward, I would continue using a modular approach, where I would first define clear requirements, design a flexible database structure, and then develop an easily maintainable backend.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design systems that address real-world challenges through technology. In this project, my work on building a functional dashboard and an efficient CRUD Python module helps companies like Grazioso Salvare manage and analyze their data more effectively. This type of work enables organizations to make informed decisions, ultimately leading to improved efficiency and performance. As businesses rely increasingly on data-driven decision-making, a well-designed system can make a significant impact, enabling companies to stay competitive and responsive to market changes.

Future Enhancements

This project is designed for future scalability. Some potential enhancements include:

- Adding authentication and authorization features to secure the data.
  
- Expanding the dashboard to support more interactive widgets or data visualizations.
  
- Optimizing the CRUD operations for better performance with large datasets.
